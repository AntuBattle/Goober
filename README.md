# Goober
Goober is a simple local password manager built in Java to showcase how sockets and threads can be used to make a simple application. 
Please note that this project has been developed for demonstration purposes and is far from a real application. 
For instance, it does not use any APIs to communicate with the server, but just encoded string (since this was the requirement for the project).
Nevertheless, it is a good example of how even without Spring and external frameworks a fully functuonal application can be developed.

To use it, just compile and run 'ServerApplication' and 'ClientApplication' in this order.
Feel free to improve on it!
